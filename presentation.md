## Slide 2: What IS Web Accessibility (A11y)?

Good morning/afternoon, everyone. Today, I want to discuss Web Accessibility, often shortened to A11y.

At its core, accessibility is about designing and building our websites and digital tools so they can be used effectively by **all** people, including those with disabilities. It focuses on enabling everyone to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web.

As Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, once said, *"Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."*

When we approach design thoughtfully with accessibility in mind, we remove digital barriers; when we overlook it, we risk creating them.

## Slide 3: It's Not Just About Disability...

So, who benefits from accessibility? While it's vital for people with permanent disabilities (visual, auditory, motor, cognitive), the impact is much broader.

Consider temporary impairments like a broken arm or an injured eye, or situational limits like using a phone in bright sunlight or trying to watch a video in a train without heatphones. Accessibility features significantly help in these common scenarios too. And let's not forget the changing abilities that come with aging. Or things like ADHD, dyslexia, or even just being in a noisy environment.

The key point is this: designing accessibly enhances the usability and experience for **everyone** across many situations.

## Slide 4: Interactive Moment: The Doors

To make this 'benefit for everyone' idea more tangible, let's try a quick interactive exercise, drawing inspiration from a talk by Clive Loseby. Imagine these two entrances:

* [Gesture Left] Automatic sliding doors
* [Gesture Right] Heavy manual doors

Let's get a quick show of hands for these situations:

* If you were using a wheelchair, what would you use? [Pause - likely Left]
* How about using a walking frame, what would you use? [Pause - likely Left]
* Carrying large boxes, what would you use? [Pause - likely Left]
* And if you were carrying a hot drink, what would you use? [Pause - likely Left]

Notice the clear preference? The solution designed for accessibility ‚Äì the automatic door ‚Äì often proves to be the most convenient and efficient option for everyone in various circumstances. Web accessibility frequently mirrors this; improvements made for specific needs often lead to a better overall user experience.

## Slide 5: Think Beyond the Mouse: Keyboard & Screen Readers

Now let's consider *how* people interact, especially without a mouse. Many navigate entirely via keyboard, either through preference or necessity due to motor or visual impairments.

They use keys like **Tab**/**Shift+Tab** to move between interactive elements, **Enter**/**Space** to activate them, and **Arrow Keys** within specific components. For these users, a clear, visible **focus indicator** ‚Äì that outline showing what's selected ‚Äì is absolutely essential for orientation.

I encourage you to try the 'Tab Test' later: navigate a complex website using only your keyboard. Observe how easy or difficult it is, and whether you can always tell where you are.

Screen readers add another critical layer for users with visual impairments. They vocalize the content, including image `alt` text, and announce element types and states ('link', 'button, pressed'). Importantly, they leverage the semantic structure *we provide* ‚Äì proper headings, landmarks like `<nav>` and `<main>` ‚Äì allowing users to navigate efficiently by jumping between sections, rather than listening linearly. This highlights why strong keyboard support and logical, semantic structure are so fundamental.

## Slide 6: Core Principles: WCAG & POUR

So, how do we systematically approach building accessible experiences? The internationally recognized standard is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG (often pronounced 'Wuh-kag'), with Level AA being the common target.

This framework is based on four core principles, easily remembered by the acronym **POUR**. These principles guide us to ensure our work is:

* **P**erceivable
* **O**perable
* **U**nderstandable
* **R**obust

Let's briefly look at what each principle entails for our different roles.

---

## Slide 7: POUR in Practice: Perceivable & Operable

First, **Perceivable**: Can users actually receive the information through their available senses?
* For images, this means providing meaningful `alt` text so screen reader users understand the image's purpose or content (Devs & Content!).
* For text, it means ensuring sufficient color contrast so it's easily distinguishable from the background, especially for users with low vision (Designers & Devs ‚Äì that 4.5:1 ratio is key!).
* And for any audio or video content, providing captions and transcripts ensures the information is accessible to those who cannot hear it. Perceivable is about making sure information can actually reach the user.

Building on that, once information is perceivable, can users effectively interact with it? This brings us to **Operable**.
* A fundamental requirement here is full keyboard accessibility ‚Äì every action must be possible without a mouse (Devs/Designers!).
* Clear, visible focus styles are crucial so keyboard users always know which element is active (Designers/Devs ‚Äì avoid removing default outlines without a better replacement!).
* Consistency in navigation and layout is also important for operability, helping users predict where things are and how they work.
* Minimizing distracting or flashing motion is vital for user comfort and safety (Designers!).
* And implementing features like 'skip navigation' links allows keyboard users to bypass repetitive elements efficiently (Devs!). Operable ensures users can successfully control and navigate the interface.

---

## Slide 8: POUR in Practice: Understandable & Robust

Next, **Understandable**: Does the information presented, and the way the interface operates, actually make sense?
* This involves using clear, straightforward language and avoiding unnecessary jargon (Content!).
* Structuring content logically with headings and lists greatly aids comprehension and scanning (Content & Designers!). Remember people skim! Clear icons and labels also help guide users.
* Consistent layouts and predictable interactions across the site reduce cognitive load (Designers!).
* Providing clear instructions and helpful, informative error messages is also essential, especially for forms (Designers & Devs!).
* And ensuring sufficient white space and readable typography contributes significantly to overall understanding. Understandable is about clarity, consistency, and ease of use.

Finally, to ensure our efforts last and work for everyone, our work must be **Robust**.
* This means they function reliably across different browsers, devices, and importantly, with various assistive technologies like screen readers, now and as technology evolves.
* The cornerstone of robustness is using standard, semantic HTML correctly ‚Äì using elements for their intended purpose (Devs!). This allows assistive technologies to interpret the structure and meaning accurately.
* Writing valid code and testing across different platforms and assistive technologies helps ensure this compatibility and prevents unexpected failures. Robustness is about building a solid, compatible foundation.

## Slide 9: Tools & Testing

Okay, we understand the principles. How do we check our work effectively? There's a range of tools available.

Automated tools, like the WAVE extension or browser DevTools, are great for catching common code-level issues ‚Äì missing `alt` text, some contrast errors ‚Äì and provide a good starting point. However, they typically only identify a fraction (maybe 30-40%) of potential accessibility barriers.

Therefore, *manual* testing is absolutely essential. Perform the keyboard 'Tab Test' yourself. Manually verify color contrast. And spending time testing with actual screen readers provides invaluable insights into the real user experience.

Ultimately, the most effective way to ensure usability is through user testing involving people with disabilities ‚Äì their direct feedback is unparalleled.

## Slide 10: Why Bother? It's Everyone's Win!

So, why should we invest the time and effort in accessibility? It's not just a compliance issue; it's fundamentally about building higher-quality products with broad benefits.

* ‚úÖ It leads to better overall **usability** for *all* users.
* üìà It significantly expands our potential **audience reach**.
* üîç Many accessibility best practices directly benefit **SEO**.
* üíñ It enhances our **brand's reputation** for inclusivity.
* ‚öñÔ∏è It helps ensure **legal compliance**, mitigating risk.
* üí° Often, designing within accessibility constraints can foster **innovation**.

## Slide 11: Helpful Resources & Tools

To help you continue learning and put this into practice, here are a few great resources and tools, broken down roughly by role:

* **For Developers:** Check out W3C validators, testing tools like Axe DevTools, and definitely the MDN accessibility docs and ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG).
* **For Designers:** Get familiar with contrast checkers (like WebAIM's or browser tools), explore accessibility plugins for Figma/Sketch, and review accessibility guidelines from major design systems.
* **For Content Creators:** Tools like Hemingway App help with readability, and guides on Plain Language and accessible writing (like alt text) are essential.

This is just a starting point, but explore these based on your role.

---

## Slide 12: Call to Action: Let's Build Together

Achieving accessibility isn't a siloed task; it requires collaboration across our teams.

* **Designers:** Integrate accessibility thinking from the earliest stages.
* **Content Creators:** Focus on clarity, structure, and good descriptions.
* **Developers:** Build that accessible technical foundation using semantic code.
* **Team Leads & PMs:** Champion accessibility by prioritizing it and allocating resources.

Everyone here can contribute by learning the fundamentals relevant to our work, staying curious, and consistently advocating for the needs of all users. Remember the 'automatic doors' example ‚Äì often, improvements made for accessibility create a better experience for everyone.
